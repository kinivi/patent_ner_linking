## Structure
- [project.ipynb](./project.ipynb) - main notebook
- [G06K.txt.gz](./G06K.txt.gz) - archive with patent texts
- [patterns.json](./patterns.json) - Hearst patterns configuration for SpaCy

## Setup
1) Untar data file
2) Install dependencies
3) Open project.ipynb and run 1st cell to chek imports
